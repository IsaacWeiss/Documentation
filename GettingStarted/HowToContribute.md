## Contributing A Patch

### For code

1. Find or submit an issue describing your proposed change to the [issue tracker](https://musescore.org/en/project/issues/musescore)
2. Please don't mix more than one logical change per submittal, because it makes the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change that doesn't have a corresponding issue in the issue tracker, please create one.
3. Fork the [code repo](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore), create branch, develop and test your code changes (see [git workflow](../WorkflowAndGuidelines/GitWorkflow.md) and [compiling and running](../CompilingAndRunning/README.md))
4. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the sample to which you are contributing (see [code guidelines](../WorkflowAndGuidelines/CodeGuidelines.md))
5. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
6. Submit a pull request.

### For documentation

1. Fork the [docs repo](https://github.com/musescore/Documentation), create branch, write your documentation changes (see [git workflow](../WorkflowAndGuidelines/GitWorkflow.md))
2. Ensure that your documentation adheres to the existing style in the sample to which you are contributing (see [docs guidelines](../WorkflowAndGuidelines/DocsGuidelines.md))
3. Submit a pull request.

## The MuseScore Development Communities

The MuseScore community exists primarily through the [chat](https://t.me/musescoreeditorchat), [forum](https://musescore.org/en/forum/687),  and the GitHub repositories.  
You are encouraged to contribute to the discussion and you can also help us to keep the effectiveness of the group high by following and promoting the guidelines listed here.  

### Please Be Friendly

Showing courtesy and respect to others is a vital part of the MuseScore culture, and we expect this from every member of the community. We hold open discussions where the opinions of each participant carry weight. Constructive criticism and the presence of different points of view is the key to the best solution. Do not be afraid to express your opinion, but also be prepared for constructive criticism.  
Let's keep it that way. Let's strive to be one of the friendliest communities in all of open source.

### Be consistent

To keep the source consistent, readable, diffable and easy to merge, we use a fairly rigid coding style, as defined by the [code guidelines](../WorkflowAndGuidelines/CodeGuidelines.md) and [docs guidelines](../WorkflowAndGuidelines/DocsGuidelines.md). All patches will be expected to conform to the style.  

### Documentations

You can find a lot of useful information in the [docs repo](https://github.com/musescore/Documentation). If something is missing, then we ask you to submit a patch for the documentation. Treat documentation as well as code.
