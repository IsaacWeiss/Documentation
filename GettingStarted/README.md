# Getting Started

So, you want to help develop and improve MuseScore?

__Welcome to a passionate and dedicated team of volunteers from around the world.__

This is how it generally works:

If you see an area that could benefit from improvement, then jump right in!

* There are a number of issues that have been identified as a good entry point for beginners [here](https://musescore.org/ru/project/issues/musescore?text=&tags=easy&status=100&priorities=All&version=All&field_target_version_value=All&severity=All&regression=All&type=All&frequency=All&reproducibility=All&workaround=All).
* If you become unsure, [ask questions](https://musescore.org/forum).
* If you are about to make a significant, or potentially controversial change, discuss it beforehand.
* Share your improvements early and openly. That way, people can let you know if you're on the right track.
