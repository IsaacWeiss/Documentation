# Development

This is the place for code documentation - code style, architecture, patterns, etc.

If you want to know where to start, or how to build, or how to translate and much more, then look [Developers' handbook](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/developers-handbook)

* [Code guidelines](CodeGuidelines.md)
* [Docs guidelines](DocsGuidelines.md)
* [Architecture](Architecture/README.md)
