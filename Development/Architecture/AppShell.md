# App shell

AppShell - this is an architectural pattern that separates the UI structure from the content. In order to be able to change the structure of the application and the components separately, independently of each other. It also controls the loading of components.

it's just a container that defines the UI structure of the application and connects the application components to each other.

AppShell defines such things as toolbars, panels, central content, status bars, component life cycle, navigation, etc.

Examples of using AppShell in other technologies:

* [AppShell for Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell)
* [Xamarin.Forms Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/shell/)
